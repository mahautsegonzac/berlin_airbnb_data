# Berlin-AirBnb-Data

The Berlin AirBnb project aims at exploring the price and rating of airbnb appartments in Berlin.
I have based my analysis on two datasets compiled on November 12th, 2019, and which can be downloaded directly from [this Kaggle folder](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) :
- listings.csv.gz
- calendar.csv.gz

## Libraries

The data preparation and analysis have been executed in Python 3.7.5.

I used the following libraries to prepare the data and perform the analysis:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- seaborn
- keplergl
- operator
- datetime

The two last libraries do not require to be installed independently from Python 3.7.5.
